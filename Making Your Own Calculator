[Making Simple Calculator]

     This lesson is about an example Python project: a simple calculator.

     The first section is the overall menu. This keeps on accepting user input until the user enters "Quit". Assume that user will input only among these - “add”, “sub”, “mul”, “div”, “Quit”, which literally means addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and quitting respectively.

     The second section will be the if-else paragraph. As the user gives us a two integer as a input, we have to distinguish which string is and make the calculation. After calculating two numbers, we have to show what’s the result.

     You must complete this project, since your code will be used as a guide for learning function. We’ll learn how to make function out of the code you’ll make.


     User input & output goes like the figure below.


     Create a code.
